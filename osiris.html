  <h1>Project Osiris</h1>
  <p>Project Osiris was a top secret experiment in human behavior proposed by social scientist Felix Frieden and internet billionaire Tamara Dunleavy in the early 1990s. Osiris was designed to explore the concept of criminality from the perspective of nature versus nurture, i.e., is an individual born evil, or does he/she become evil through the influence of the environment and experience?</p>
  <p>The results were expected to revolutionize our thinking with regard to the court and penal systems and change crime and punishment as we know it. The proposed experiment involved human cloning, the medical process of creating exact genetic twins of living people through the harvesting of their DNA. Under Osiris, clones would be created of the greatest criminal masterminds currently in prison.</p>
  <p>The babies born would be raised by surrogate parents in a fabricated community, geographically isolated and carefully protected from any exposure to illegality, violence, deception, and fraud. The subject children would be exact replicas of the very worst humans in society, yet they would be free from all negative influence. Careful monitoring would reveal whether the clones have fulfilled the destiny of the evil in their DNA or if their decent and upright environment had nurtured gentle, law-abiding adults.</p>
  <p>While initially hailed for its scientific approach to social issues, Project Osiris was criticized for its callous use of human life for research purposes and for its lack of endgame. The plan referred to a possible shift once the cloned subjects reached fourteen years of age, but few details would be provided on what would happen beyond then. These concerns, along with the international ban on human cloning, led to the abandonment of Project Osiris in 1999.</p>
  <p>Dr. Hammerstrom resigned from the faculty of the University of Colorado and dropped out of sight. Tamara Dunleavy went into retirement and now lives in seclusion on a ranch outside Jackson Hole, Wyoming.</p>
